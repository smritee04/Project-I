                ANNAPURNA CIRCUIT TREK
            </h1>
            <div>
               <h3>Where Is The Annapurna Circuit Trek?</h3>
               <p>The Annapurna Circuit Trek is a trek on the Annapurna Circuit. Simple as that. But where do you find the Annapurna Circuit? When you think Nepal and the Himalaya, your first thought is probably the Everest Base Camp trek. The Himalaya are of course massive and on the other side of Nepal, you can find mountains that are almost just as high as you would find in the Everest Region, the Khumbu region. You can find the Annapurnas close to Pokhara, about 6 hours northwest of Kathmandu. The small city, known as the City of Lakes, is the gateway to the Annapurna Massif.</p>
               <p>This mountain is named after Annapurna, the Hindu goddess of food and nourishment, who, is said to have her home in the Annapurnas. The name Annapurna is derived from the Sanskrit. It is a combination of the words purna ("filled") and anna ("food"), and can be translated as "everlasting food". Many streams descending from the slopes of the Annapurna Massif provide water for the agricultural sector located at a lower altitude.</p>
               <h3>Mountains on the Annapurna Circuit</h3>
               <p>The Annapurna Massif is the main supplier of huge peaks on the Annapurna Circuit. This massif is home to one peak over 8000 meters, thirteen peaks over 7000 meters and sixteen more over 6000 meters. To give you some perspective: Mount Kilimanjaro is 5,896 meters high. The following peaks you can see when you are trekking the Annapurna Circuit.

                <h3>Annapurna Circuit Trail Length</h3>
                <p>The total length of the Annapurna Circuit is anything between 160 and 230 kilometers (100-145 miles). The length of the Annapurna Circuit depends on where ground transportation is used and not. Because a part of the circuit is tarred these days, some trekkers decide to skip this. For the same reason, a lot of trekking enthusiasts decide to do the Manaslu Circuit trek instead. Most itineraries offered for the Annapurna Circuit Trek these days are shorter than three weeks, which used to be the common duration of trekking the circuit.
                </p>
                <p>When you are browsing itineraries, it makes more sense to look at the number of days than the distance. If you want to do the Annapurna Circuit Trek the right way, make sure to do it in at least 15 days. Below we give you a great example of a 15-day itinerary. If you have more time, you can also do it in 18 days. Both will allow for perfect acclimatization while being able to fully soak up the beauty of the Annapurna Massif.
                </p>
                <h3>Tarred Road on the Annapurna Circuit</h3>
                <p>Tar on the Annapurna Circuit? Correct. When you think of trekking in Nepal, you don’t think you would need to hike on tarred roads, would you? When talking about trekking, we talk about seasons. In a good season, it’s absolutely fine to hike the most remote trails but imagine the low season, when there is Monsoon and trails are muddy and inaccessible. A tarred road can make all the difference in the lives of locals. The trails you use for trekking and for fun are used by the local community to live their daily lives. A road which enables for quick access to goods and supplies is a massive upgrade.
                </p>
                <p>“The Annapurna Circuit is currently tarred between Muktinath to Tatopani and from Besishar to Chame”, says Chhatra Karki of Nepal Eco Adventure. Nepal Eco Adventure has a 15-day Annapurna Circuit Trek on offer and Chhatra knows that the roads are not there to ruin the trekking experience. “The local communities profit a lot from upgrading the infrastructure. The area can not just live from the trekking industry alone.”</p>
                <h3>18-day or 15-day Annapurna Circuit Trek: Differences in difficulty and length</h3>
                <p>“Back in the day we used to offer an 18-day version of the Annapurna Circuit Trek but these days it makes more sense to do the 15-day version. The parts that are tarred can be bridged by a car. This allows trekkers to rest their legs a little bit and to recharge their batteries for the next stretch of trekking”, explain Chhatra of Nepal Eco Adventure. “In the past, people have said that you should do the Manaslu Circuit instead because it is a lot less touristy and it doesn’t involve any driving. However, the Manaslu Circuit is also very busy now and all the highlights of the Annapurna Circuit are still there.”</p>
                <p>“Also,” Chhatra elaborates, “The Annapurna Circuit is not that busy as it used to be. The number of trekkers has reduced on the Circuit and in terms of difficulty one can say that the Annapurna Circuit is not too difficult.”</p>
                <p>Chhatra is right. The Annapurna Circuit is not a very technical trek and in terms of difficulty it isn’t ranking very high either. “It really is for everyone”, Chhatra says. Below you can find an itinerary for the 15-day Annapurna Circuit Trek as offered by Nepal Eco Adventure.</p>
               <h3> Annapurna Circuit Trek Itinerary. Including Altitude (height) per day.</h3>
                    The Annapurna Circuit is best done in 15 days or 18 days. The 18-day version is in that regard more old school and just follows the trails where this is possible. More and more people choose to do the 15-day version, however. If you do the Annapurna Circuit Trek in 15 days, you are sure to have a small break halfway while still being able to enjoy all the highlights the Annapurna Circuit offers.annapurna-circuit-trek-nepal-eco-adventure
                    <h4>15-day Annapurna Circuit Trek by Nepal Eco Adventure</h4>
                    <h4> 01 – Drive to Besisahar (923m) and trekking to Bulbule.</h4>
                    <p> Kathmandu, we start early for our drive to Besisahar. We travel by bus arranged by us. The road up to Besisahar is of fair quality. Once we have reached Besisahar we walk about another two hours to Bulebule close to Marysangdi river. It’s an easy trek to Bulbule after the long bus journey. Once we reach there, we freshen up and spend the night there.
                    <h>Day 02 – Trek to Chamje (1410m)</h>
                    <p>On the first day of the trek, we cross various suspension bridges, waterfalls and continue past rice paddies and forests. Once we reach the cliff in Jagat, we can view the Marsyangdi Khola below and rocky hills all around. The beehives at the top of the cliffs are an attraction for today. In a short while we will reach Chamje where we spend the night.</p>
                    <h4>Day 03 – Trek to Bagarchhap (2160m)</h4>
                    <p>As we move past narrow and steep valleys, through rhododendron, pine and bamboo forests, in the rocky folds of a mountain, we come across a bridge that takes us to a quick ascent and finally atop a climb to reveal a widening valley. After reaching the village of Tal, we have to move across barley, wheat and potato farms for a while before we reach Dharapani. From there we turn west through the fir and pine forests to reach Bagarchhap.</p>
                    <h4> 04 – Trek to Chame (2710m)</h4>
                    <p> Reom Bagarchhap we start ahead to reach a Danaque village and then a steep climb to reach a Tamang village with exquisite views of Manaslu, Lamjung , Annapurna and other mountain beauties. As we trek through a Tibetan village that acts as a transition between the lowlands and high hills, we follow a gradual flat path to Thanchowk, Kolo and finally to Chame.</p>
                   <h4> Day 05 – Trek to Pisang (3240m)</h4>
                   <p> We first pass through the older part of Chame, climb up to Telekhu and continue on a long, leveled trail through forests underway to Brathang. The trails rounds a bend and once we continue ahead we need to cross back to the south bank of Marsyangdi River on a suspension bridge. Then the trail takes us on a gentle ascent over a pine forested ridge and then levels again as we move from the upper part of Manang valley to Pisang.</p>
                    <h4> Day 06 – Trek to Manang (3540m)</h4>
                    <p>The town of Pisang is the start of the upper region of the Manang district. On this day, the trek climbs to Braga, a Tibetan styled village. The houses here are stacked upon each other forming verandas with each others rooftops. The main attraction is the Gompa, the largest in the district, with a vast array of statues in display and perched on a high crag with the view of the entire village. After a while we reach Manang, where we freshen up and spend the night.</p>
                    <h4> Day 07 – Acclimatisation in Manang</h4>
                    <p>As we are reaching higher altitudes, we need to acclimatize to avoid the risk of altitude sickness. Manang is the perfect spot with its beautiful natural setting and a hike up to Khangsar in the afternoon for a short detour.</p>
                    <h4> Day 08 – Trek to Yak Kharka (4120m)</h4>
                    Now that we are rested, we feel rejuvenated to continue on our trek. As we move past the tall trees towards the alpine grass and junipers, we reach meadows where a few horses and a number of yaks are grazing around. The serene environment with meadows and steep slopes of Yak Kharka is the perfect place for us to spend the night. We can also choose to walk for an hour to reach Letdar and spend the night there</p>
                    <h4>Day 09 – Trek to Thorung Phedi (4.560m)</h4>
                    <p>Trekking to Letdar helps getting acclimatized to the increasing altitude as we ascend along the east bank of Jarang Khola. In some time we reach a meadow surrounded by vertical cliffs, the Thorung Phedi. Sighting of blue sheep and snow leopards have been reported a few times in the area, whereas Lammergeyers and griffons are quite common. We spend the night here.</p>
                    <h4>Day 10 – Over Thorung La (5.416m) to Muktinath (3.802m) – 8 hours</h4>
                    <p>Today we will hike for about 7-8 hours. The trail is comparatively easier having been trodden for years, but could get difficult with strong winds in the upper regions. The trail is believed to have been used for hundreds of years to take sheep and yaks in and out of Manang along with other trading goods. We reach Thorung Phedi in about 6 hours. After we reach Thorung la pass, our hike will be rewarded with beautiful views of Annapurna, Gangapurna and a heavily glaciated peak of Khatungkang. When are a done with a descent of about 1600m, we view the glorious Dhaulagiri standing in the distance. After a while, the trail becomes less steep and enters grassy fields and meadows to finally reach Muktinath. In Hindu religion, Muktinath refers to a place of nirvana which houses a temple and a number of monasteries, making it a holy site for Hindus and Buddhists alike. The main attractions of the site are the Jwalamai temple with a spring and an eternal flame as well as the 108 water spouts that pour holy water. These are visited by thousands of pilgrims every year.</p>
                    <h4>Day 11 – Trek to Jomsom (2750m) via Kagbeni.</h4>
                    <p>From Muktinath, we follow a trail part of the Jomsom trek where we descend through meadows, streams and fruit trees to finally reach Kagbeni. We look around the old village and then moving downwards. From Kagbeni we reach Jomson, Kali Gandaki valley.</p>
                    <h4>Day 12 – Drive to Tatopani (1190) – Hot Water Springs</h4>
                    <p>The road from Marpha to Kalopani goes via a new trail past Chokhopani village which is a traditional Thakali village. The panoramic views of the Himalayas include Nilgiri, Dhaulagiri, Tukuche, Annapurna and many other snow-capped peaks. From here we cross a river and a newly constructed road that will make us finally reach Kalopani.</p>
                    <h4>Day 13 – Trek to Ghorepani (2750m)</h4>
                    <p>Today we move from Tatopani through villages of midland Nepal with terraced fields and inclined farmlands. As we hike and ascend we move past rhododendron, magnolia and other vegetation of the area. We finally reach Ghorepani as we witness the beautiful mountains in the evening sky. We rest in Ghorepani to make an early start pushing for Poonhill in the morning.</p>
                    <h4>Day 14 – Ghorepani – Poonhill – Nayapul. Drive to Pokhara – 7 hours</h4>
                    <p>We have an early morning ascent of Poonhill for the sunrise. This has to be the highlight of the trek as we make our trip to the vantage point early in the morning with sunrise. Once you see the snow-capped peaks highlighted in the changing golden rays of the sunrise, it will be one of the most unforgettable moments of your life. The peaks in the scenery include the Annapurna range and Dhaulagiri. Known as a photographer’s paradise, we can spend some time here taking breathtaking pictures of the spellbinding surroundings, capturing the spectacular moments in a frame. We then descend to Ghorepani for breakfast and then trek for 5 hours down to Nayapul. The first part of the trek down until Tikhedhunga is quite steep down hill. From there we move past terraced fields for a few hours to reach Nayapul. From there a short drive will finally take us to Pokhara.</p>
                    <h4>Day 15 - Return drive to Kathmandu and transfer to hotel – 7 uur</h4>
                    <p>After enjoying beautiful Pokhara and its natural and cultural beauty, we begin our drive towards Kathmandu. After about 6-7 hours, we finally reach Kathmandu. We can either rest or go discover the tourist attractions in the capital city.</p>

            <h3> Best Season for the Annapurna Circuit Trek</h3> 
                    <p></p>The Annapurna Region, along with the rest of Nepal has 4 distinct seasons. Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. The months from March to May and from October or November are the most popular for trekking at the Annapurna Massif. If you are thinking of doing the Annapurna Circuit in the wet season, know that this is possible. The Annapurna Circuit sits in a rain shadow, which allows for trekking during monsoon as well.</p>
                    <h4>Spring (March to May)</h4>
                    <p>Spring is the perfect season for the Annapurna Circuit Trek. It is your best chance to see rhododendron in full bloom and to spot the most beautiful birds. You can expect it to be quite busy on the trials.</p>
                    <h4>Summer (June to August)</h4>
                    <div>
                        <img src="/images/pp6.jpeg" alt="m6">
                    </div>
                    <p></p>When talking trekking in Nepal, not many people would advise you to go trekking in summer, which is the time of monsoon. However, as the Annapurna Circuit finds itself in a rain shadow, it is perfectly suited for trekking during the wet season.rhododendron-nepal-spring-annapurna-circuit</p>
                    <h4>Autumn (September - November)</h4>
                    <p>Autumn is by far the most popular trekking season in Nepal. Because of the little bit of rain that the Annapurnas received (it doesn’t get much), everything is vibrant and has come back to life. Teahouses book up quickly and it is generally very busy on the circuit.</p>
                   <h4> Winter (December - February)</h4>
                    <p>Winter is the trickiest season when it comes to trekking the Annapurna Circuit. Although teahouses remain open, it can happen that the wintery conditions cause the Thorung La Pass to close. This, however, doesn’t have to mean that you can’t do or complete the circuit. Just make sure to plan in a few days of margin. Else you might get late for work.</p>
